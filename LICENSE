Archon is **free, open, and hackable.** Run it, fork it, and share it — no strings attached — except one: **don’t sell it as‑a‑service without talking to us first.**

---

### 1  You Can

* **Run** Archon anywhere, for anything, for free.
* **Study & tweak** the code, add features, change the UI—go wild.
* **Share** your changes or forks publicly (must keep this license in place).

### 2  Please Do

* Keep this license notice and a link back to the main repo.
* Mark clearly if you’ve modified Archon.

### 3  You Can’t (Without Permission)

* Charge money for Archon itself—e.g. paid downloads, paywalled builds, or subscriptions.
* Offer Archon (original or modified) as a hosted or managed service that others can sign up for.
* Bundle Archon into another paid product.

> **Consulting/support is totally fine.** Get paid to install, customise, or teach Archon as long as your clients don’t get a hosted Archon instance run by you.

### 4  No Warranty

Archon comes **as‑is** with **no warranty** of any kind.

### 5  Limitation of Liability

We’re **not liable** for any damages resulting from using Archon.
